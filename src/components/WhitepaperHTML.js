We are purposely not filling this document with overly technical jargon and diagrams that you will skim over. Rather, we are highlighting the problem that the protocol solves and how we will drive adoption and monetary performance.<br /><br />The paper is structured with myriad sections that highlight the main idea with a brief sentence. You are welcome to dig into the detail further within if you want a more detailed review.<br /><br />Knowing that blockchain is still in the early adoption phase, we’d love your feedback! Anyone who feels any details are missing is welcome to join our <span className="c24 c36"><a className="c6" href="https://skratch.slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack channel</a></span> and engage in the conversation. Any recurring questions will be added to subsequent versions of this document. <br /></span></p>

                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">Skratch is a decentralized marketplace protocol that allows users to make secure transactions where their conversations happen. The protocol is also a mechanism for sites to access hidden revenue from commissions on the trades that happen on the marketplace within their site.</span></p>
                          <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">In practice, users build peer to peer smart contracts that act as both the escrow and governance for their transactions. Our visual smart contract builder allows users to leverage a series of data-driven verification steps to ensure that funds are only released to sellers once the buyers have received what they’ve purchased.</span></p>
                          <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">We’re building the protocol atop the Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric blockchains and allowing anyone to participate as a host site and/or a mining node. For participating sites we’re creating an SDK, a series of plugins that integrate with existing Content Management Systems and message board software, and a series of browser extensions that make participation effortless for users.</span></p>
                          <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">The Skratch token is the mechanism of payment across the network for miners, host sites, participants and the network itself. While we will launch as part of existing blockchains, our ultimate goal is to build our own blockchain in 2019 for purposes of better speed and security of the protocol.</span></p>

                             <p className="c14"><span className="c3">With the recent acquisition of UndergroundHipHop.com (UGHH), our CEO Michael King has dug into his unique experiences as an independent hiphop musician and as a technical marketer. Recalling an experience that made him a meme in 2005, he’s recognized a need to build a secure, decentralized, and low-friction marketplace for patrons of message boards and social media channels.</span></p>
                             <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                             <p className="c14"><span className="c3">Back in the early noughties, King met an artist through the UGHH forums and hired him to record a chorus for a song. That artist was paid, but never followed through on his end of the deal. It took years to recover the funds and, as an indie musician, any amount money lost can be make-or-break. This is a problem for users of any kind and is something that blockchain can easily solve through smart contracts. Smart contracts introduce users to the capability to secure their transactions through clear cut data-driven conditions and store their funds until those conditions are met.</span></p>
                             <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                             <p className="c14"><span className="c24">On the other hand, for the sites that host these conversations and create a place for these relationships to form, these transactions are revenue that is otherwise hidden. Users meet each other in these channels and discuss the trade of vinyl records, beats, and hiring for performances, but the site itself gets no value out of the marketplace its existence has created. Many of these sites are hanging on by thin threads weaved by gaudy and disruptive advertising. A decentralized marketplace creates another revenue stream for media sites to thrive and focus on more valuable content.</span></p>
                             <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                             <p className="c14"><span className="c3">Cryptocurrency and the smart contract concept create a compelling mechanism for developing a low-friction environment that allows users to trade securely and gives the host sites access to hidden revenue in the form of commissions from these trades.</span></p>

Introducing Skratch as a monetization engine gives those sites more options and the ability to focus on higher quality content rather than clickbait.<br /></span></li>

                             <p className="c14"><span className="c3">For physically delivered goods, verification could happen through a combination of image matching using computer vision APIs and tracking numbers. For instance, the buyer and seller can collectively build &nbsp;a smart contract and the seller can take a picture or a series of pictures of the contents of the box and provide the tracking number and details of the package such as dimensions or weight. Once the shipping carrier’s tracking API indicates that the package has been delivered, the buyer has a specified number of days to verify the contents of the package. Upon receipt, the buyer uploads pictures of the items received using our mobile app and if they match, the funds are released. The smart contract also indicates that if the seller does not remedy any issues within X number of days after delivery, their refundable deposit is lost in addition to the funds being returned to the buyer. Finally, should the buyer not verify the package within that timeframe, the funds are automatically released to the seller. Should a dispute arise, both users’ TrustScores will be reviewed in context of the verified completion steps and funds will be released to the more trusted user.</span></p>

The dispute resolution function would multiply the number of completed steps for both parties by their respective TrustScores and compare them similar to how Quality Score works for Google’s AdWords. Whichever number is greater is the winner of the dispute. If the dispute score is close then the losing user has the ability to appeal the algorithmic decision.</span></p>

The buyer, looking for a product or service, finds a very specific item they can’t find on eBay or Amazon from a seller that has a detailed understanding of their need, but they cannot necessarily trust a seller they meet outside the guardrails of a standard marketplace. The seller has a unique product or service that won’t gain much attention on a non-specific marketplace, but cannot necessarily trust potential patrons they meet on message boards or social media. The host site is already creating opportunities for people to meet but is now able to benefit from those relationships in a monetary sense.</span></p>

                             <p className="c14"><span className="c24">A host site gets attributed the commission from any relationships where the first transaction happens due to their site. For instance, if a user talks to another user on a number of sites on the network, but does not execute a smart contract until they came to Site A, then Site A gets the commission for any transaction those two users partake in on any site p</span><span className="c24">articipating in Skratch as long as Site A participates</span><span className="c3">&nbsp;in the network.</span></p>
                             <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                             <p className="c14"><span className="c3">However, if two users connect on a site via the browser extension and that site is not a member of the network, the entirety of the commission is absorbed by Skratch.</span></p>
                             <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                             <p className="c14"><span className="c24">The host site revenue model is such that the hosting site can determine the revenue split between themselves and Skratch up to 80/20 in their direction. However, the higher the revenue split is in their favor, the more posts of products representing relationships outside of their site will be added by our plugins this allows</span><span className="c24">&nbsp;Skratch to continue to maximize its own revenue by placing higher margin posts on sites across the decentralized network.</span></p>

                             <p className="c14"><span className="c9">The underlying technical details of this concept are not necessarily difficult, but also not trivial in scale. Rather they are tedious because Skratch requires the building of a JavaScript SDK as an abstraction layer to Web3JS and the Fabric client. This allows sites to create custom Skratch integrations as well as the development of a variety of plugins for various content management systems, message board software, web development frameworks and mobile apps.</span></p>

We recognize that adoption is all about ease so we will systematically rollout plugins and apps starting with the most popular message board solutions such as vBulletin and work our way down into lesser used forums such as Vanilla Forums and Phorum. The following is an indication of the top 10 forum softwares currently in use across the web.</span></p>

                             <p className="c14"><span className="c3">The Skratch protocol is a DApp that acts as a parent contract to a series of user generated children smart contracts built on a library of functions. The DApp and master parent contract manages the host site relationships to the protocol while the child contracts manage the relationship between buyer-seller-host site and the protocol. These contracts are generated peer to peer and then pushed to the Ethereum blockchain. External conditions are reviewed against calls to Oraclize.It recursively until the conditions are met or expire based on the criteria in the child smart contract.</span></p>

                             <p className="c14"><span>Hyperledger Fabric acts as a decentralized data store for posts and messages across the network while Ethereum acts as the escrow with deployed smart contracts. Most of the functionality is managed on the frontend and handled by the MadeFromSkratch library in the plugins and browser extension. Plugins and browser extensions store the user relationship to their blockchain accounts which allows the frontend apps to pull data on demand or have it pushed from the server as events occur. For all oracles, we will prepare a single verification API endpoint that pulls from all of data sources that connect to the various verification APIs and return their data. This is to ensure that if verification sources are DDOS’d neither party is penalized.</span><span>For our initial launch, these servers will be hosted by Skratch, but we will provide Docker containers and encourage miners to join the decentralized network from as soon as the network goes online. We will also encourage host sites to host their own mining nodes.</span></p>

                             <p className="c14"><span className="c3">In the spirit of quick deployment, we will launch on the Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric blockchains, but we will make the switch to our own blockchain in 2019 for the following reasons:</span></p>
                             <h4 className="c52" id="h.2fn9sevdnvls"><span className="c49 c24">Friction Concerns</span></h4>
                             <p className="c14"><span className="c18">The biggest issue with nearly all cryptocurrency based applications and projects is that using them is akin to setting up a Linux server. The numerous steps to get up and running will continue to make all projects high friction. We want Skratch to be as easy to get started as buying a product on Amazon.</span></p>
                             <h4 className="c52" id="h.2fn9sevdnvls-1"><span className="c49 c24">Speed Concerns</span></h4>
                             <p className="c14"><span className="c18">The volume of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain makes it slow and inefficient in production and we are still currently in the early adoption phase of the protocol. As the Ethereum protocol grows, the volume of transactions will also increase and potentially create a poor user experience for our user base. Race conditions in the real world verification could potentially break the whole model. Our ideal future state includes host sites hosting nodes on the Skratch blockchain in addition to miners for speed and true decentralization.</span></p>
                             <h4 className="c52" id="h.2fn9sevdnvls-2"><span className="c24 c49">Consensus Considerations</span></h4>
                             <p className="c14"><span className="c18">Currently, Ethereum is a Proof of Work protocol and while Proof of Stake is being explored in subsequent releases, we want to solely rely on a Proof of Stake consensus with Skratch.</span></p>

                             <li className="c2"><span className="c21">Call Stack limit and Gas limit attacks - </span><span className="c3">When smart contracts call other smart contracts Ethereum builds a call stack and gas limit for contracts in the stack. If you run out of gas during this, Ethereum arbitrarily and silently skip calls making the logic of smart contract stack potentially fall apart and exploitable.<br /></span></li>

                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">We expect that Skratch has applications in a variety of, if not all, verticals. We expect that there will be simple Fashion and Technology vertical applications such as the buying and selling of clothing and clothing design work or the buying and selling of development work and gadgets. These use cases can be verified using the very same mechanisms laid out for the music vertical.</span></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">However, it is our goal to develop a series of oracles for the systematic expansion into these verticals starting in 2019. Additionally, we expect that users will shoehorn Skratch into transactions across verticals before we officially go into them thereby allowing us to crowd source use cases by reviewing transactions. Members of the decentralized protocol will also have the ability to suggest oracles and their use cases for addition to the protocol.</span></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">As an example, in the technology vertical, a user might devise an oracle for the purchase of source code wherein that a Git repository could be provided and resulting source code could be compiled and run against a series of expected results.</span></p>

                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">While the technical details are not trivial, the largest issue to overcome with adoption is awareness and the development of a network of host sites. Surely, the decentralized network can thrive on its own through the creation of a browser extension, but the growth of the host site network will accelerate user growth dramatically by capitalizing on pre-existing audiences. </span></p>

We will ramp up existing UGHH efforts with the goal to build out our audience and mailing lists. Once the Skratch protocol has launched, the marketing effort shifts to the promotion of both brands as they are interconnected until the Skratch network grows beyond UGHH itself towards the end of 2018.</span></p>

                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">Skratch offers access to hidden revenue through the commission of transactions that happen between users of a given website. The series of plugins that we’re building make connecting a website to this revenue stream plug and play in that it only requires the host site to register a crypto wallet, install a plugin and configure payout options.</span></p>
                          <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">The concept is a compelling offer to sites the feature communities and monetize largely through advertising. These sites typically design themselves to trick the user to click on ads through annoying pagination, pop-ups, click-jacking and confusing image placements. Skratch introduces a new mechanism for revenue that can potentially put the power back into the hands of sites and compel them to invest more into content quality.</span></p>
                          <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">In support of growing the network, we will hire a business development team within the organization to build exclusive partnerships with key sites in the space with the goal of bringing on 80 websites per quarter. New users will be incentivized with 10 free use-or-lose tokens to make a transaction within their first 30 days. We will grow the usage of the network by allowing users to invite their friends, giving them both 5 use-or-lose Skratch tokens with 30 day expiration.</span></p>
                          <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">We will execute an influencer and content marketing campaign and purchase ads on host sites. The latter tactic increases brand awareness and ensures that media buys are big enough to compel host sites give the network at least a 30-day shot.</span></p>
                          <p className="c0">

                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">Finally, we will give users collateral within the network to send to other webmasters inviting them to join the Skratch network and incentivizing them with 100 tokens for any site that joins.</span></p><h2 className="c22" id="h.jonppuq3xg9i"><span className="c11">Comparison to Existing Solutions</span></h2><p className="c14"><span className="c32 c28">In-experience trading and granular smart contracts sets Skratch apart from existing solutions.</span></p><h3 className="c19" id="h.wr42xm2a0u80"><span className="">OpenBazaar</span></h3><p className="c14"><span className="c3">Skratch differs from OpenBazaar in that there is no need for the buyer or seller to download a specific software application nor host any portion of a blockchain on their own machine to participate. OpenBazaar also does not leverage granular smart contracts to govern their transactions. In fact, representatives of the company believe there’s no way to effectively verify a commerce transaction with smart contracts due to the fact that a buyer or seller could take drastic measures to sabotage the verification mechanisms.</span></p><p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p><p className="c14"><span style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'block', margin: '30px auto', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', WebkitTransform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', width: '100%', height: 'auto'}}><img alt src="//images.contentful.com/j5zy0n17n2ql/13r8LVIonMy62Ea6CYQCi6/621a13b367e4099d54103f00c2a707ef/wp-image27.png" style={{width: '100%', height: 'auto', marginLeft: '0.00px', marginTop: '0.00px', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', WebkitTransform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)'}} title /></span></p><p className="c40"><span className="c24 c37">Source - </span><span className="c24 c36 c37"><a className="c6" href="https://medium.com/@therealopenbazaar/the-case-for-dumb-contracts-6308aa5b757">https://medium.com/@therealopenbazaar/the-case-for-dumb-contracts-6308aa5b757</a></span></p><p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p><p className="c14"><span className="c3">Open Bazaar uses a potentially unscalable approach of incentivized mediators to verify transactions and release funds in the case of dispute.

They also tend to have support staff to help in the case of any disputes and there are simple mechanisms for reversing payments that tend to work entirely in the buyer’s favor. PayPal specifically, is already ubiquitous across the web with its various plugins and gateways and is made to be plugged into a variety of systems across the web. However, PayPal usually takes the user out of native experience and into the PayPal experience to make the payment and has been known to arbitrarily freeze funds of its users. All of these solutions also charge around 3% per commercial transaction.</span></p><h3 className="c19" id="h.128yr7bp23qh"><span>Odesk, Elance, and other Marketplaces</span></h3><p className="c14"><span style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'block', margin: '30px auto', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', WebkitTransform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', width: '100%', height: 'auto'}}><img alt src="//images.contentful.com/j5zy0n17n2ql/bkktehDMpqkAY0K4awmgs/bef90ae0de14f3667228a69badf364bf/wp-image2.jpg" style={{width: '100%', height: 'auto', marginLeft: '0.00px', marginTop: '0.00px', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', WebkitTransform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)'}} title /></span><span className="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">In comparing Skratch to service marketplaces such as Odesk, Elance, Freelancer, and 99Designs, these sites do provide human support for dispute resolution, but the transaction fees on these networks tend to be incredibly high for the seller with rates varying from 8.75% - 40%. An average 3% fee is charged to the buyer as well. These platforms also require the buyer and seller to go to them directly rather than have the transaction happen natively where users may meet, thus cutting out the ability of host sites to get a commission. Finally, no one goes to these sites in search of producers, recording engineers or other music personnel. </span></p>
                          <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">Anonymity is an option on these sites, but people always look for ways to de-anonymize users to build trust and enter a service relationship.</span></p>
                          <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">Skratch is superior to these solutions in that it leverages smart contracts, allows the user to remain within their native site experience for communication and charges a fixed 1.5% per transaction that host sites can use for monetization.</span></p>
                          <h2 className="c22" id="h.goqrw51um6ms"><span className="c11">Strategy to get on Exchanges</span></h2>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">Our goal is to get the token on the exchanges &nbsp;60 days after the completion of the public token sale to allow participants in the token sale to freely trade them. However, it is our goal to showcase actual value rather than just speculative. To that end, the Skratch token will be a valid method of payment that customers can use on UndergroundHipHop.com shortly after the close of the pre-sale. Being that UndergroundHipHop.com has a history of 7-figure revenue performance, allowing Skratch tokens to be used on our e-commerce site in exchange for access to exclusive content and discounts on the goods they are purchasing will quickly create demand for tokens among our existing customer-base of over 100k people. </span></p>
                          <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">We will make our smart contracts and all other relevant code available for auditing at the Skratch GitHub account so the relevant exchanges and third parties can ensure that we’re not hiding malicious instructions that will rob them of their funds. We’ll also make the smart contract library that comprises the granular smart contract builder available on GitHub.</span></p>
                          <p className="c0"><span className="c3" /></p>
                          <p className="c14"><span className="c3">Once we’ve proven the demand of the token, we will immediately approach altcoin exchanges such as Poloniex and Shapeshift, proposing that Skratch be included for trade on these exchanges, highlighting the transaction activity. With Black Friday and Cyber Monday on the horizon, we anticipate that the growth in demand will position Skratch to hit the altcoin exchanges within 60 days after the close of the token sale.</span></p>

                             <li className="c2"><span className="c25 c21">What if a seller sends a box of rocks? What if a buyer fakes a verification step?</span><span className="c9"><br />The smart contracts will have mechanisms for dispute resolution that rely on the review of the completed steps versus the trustworthiness of the user based on their transaction history. If all else fails a user can appeal an automated dispute decision by interfacing with humans for dispute resolution. However, in any transaction the penalty fee is paid to the network by the noncompliant party.<br /></span></li>

                             <li className="c2"><span className="c25 c21">Blockchain identities are anonymous what is to stop a user from making a bunch of accounts?</span><span className="c9"><br />Yes, identity is anonymous on the blockchain, but there are two layers of identity in this case. First, the user’s identity on the message board or social network. Second, the user’s wallet identity on Skratch. Both of these identities carry equity with them that the user may not want to discard. On the message board or social network, there is their persona that they may have worked for years to build up. On Skratch, there is the TrustScore that they build up over a series of transactions. So while the user could indeed create many identities, they are at a disadvantage in dispute resolution on the Skratch protocol if they do so.</span></li>

                             <li className="c2"><span className="c21">What are Skratch Tokens?</span><span className="c3"><br /><br />The Skratch tokens are software with cryptographic elements that are sold out as a utility appliance for the Skratch platform. The Skratch tokens are based on the Ethereum protocol and conform to the widely-used ERC20 standard.<br /><br />The Skratch tokens have their functional utility only within the Skratch protocol and their creation is conditioned by the need to develop an internal economy in the Skratch ecosystem that will establish transparent and fair relations among the Skratch community.<br /><br />The Skratch tokens are intended to be used by their holders only for its designated purposes. Number of such purposes may be increased over time, including, but not limited to, by means of adding new products, services and features available in exchange for the Skratch tokens.<br /><br />
                                </span></li>

The full functionality of the Skratch protocol is available only for Skratch token holders. We plan to place the Skratch tokens on cryptographic token exchanges within 60 days of the completion of the token sale, giving an opportunity to openly buy them (to residents of countries where the purchase of tokens does not violate local laws). A user seeking to enter the Skratch protocol will have to buy the Skratch tokens at the such exchanges. Conversely, the Skratch tokens could be sold at an exchange if their holder would like to exit the Skratch ecosystem.<br /><br />However, legislation on the circulation of securities in certain countries may prohibit the sale of the Skratch tokens to the residents of those countries. When buying the Skratch tokens, the purchaser should be aware of the restrictions on their subsequent sale and thereby obliges to follow our instructions and/or those of the exchange when he/she resells them to other users.<br /><br /></span><span className="c21">Form of settlement.</span><span className="c3">&nbsp;The Skratch tokens will be used as a form of settlement in the transactions conducted within the Skratch protocol. In particular, Skratch tokens holders may be able to use their Skratch tokens to purchase services and products to be offered within the Skratch platform or on UndergroundHipHop.com.<br /><br /></span></li>
