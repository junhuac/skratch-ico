Once the seller uploads the product (the track) and the buyer approves that the product is what he’s looking for, the buyer’s Skratch tokens will be released to the seller.

These sites typically design themselves to trick the user to click on ads through annoying pagination, pop-ups, click-jacking and confusing image placements. Skratch introduces a new mechanism for revenue that can potentially put the power back into the hands of sites and compel them to invest more into content quality."},paragraph8:{paragraph8:"In support of growing the network, we will hire a business development team within the organization to build exclusive partnerships with key sites in the space with the goal of bringing on 80 websites per quarter. New users will be incentivized with 10 free use-or-lose tokens to make a transaction within their first 30 days.

In many cases, these users connect with each other and take leaps of faith to buy products or services from other unknown users. The problem is evident: these transactions are insecure, and nothing governs them. Because of this, there’s a likely drop-off in transactions because users have to move onto other third-party sites or apps (like Venmo, Paypal) to send funds."},paragraph2:{paragraph2:"Our solution? Skratch: a decentralized marketplace protocol for music sites where users can buy/sell/trade products and services securely for Skratch tokens. Clearly, in an industry as large as the music industry, the marketplace is widely distributed despite a large number of host sites, buyers, and sellers. Skratch creates a mechanism for a host site to monetize the trades that happen on their website--providing convenience for buyers and sellers, and commissions for hosts."},paragraph3:{paragraph3:"In practice, Skratch is a series of plugins and browser extensions created to allow host sites to plug and play with the Skratch protocol easily. Users can connect their various message board identities to their wallets and complete their transactions with the level of anonymity that they see fit for any given transaction."},paragraph4:{paragraph4:"The elements of trust and security are governed by smart contracts that are created in our visual smart contract builder. Our granular smart contracts are built from a library of functions that represent immutable verification steps. This is not just limited to consumer items such as CDs and vinyl, but also professional items such as original production, equipment or services such as mixing and mastering of tracks. The further expansion into fashion and technology will be through the identification of other relevant oracles and use cases."},paragraph5:{paragraph5:"Skratch will debut on UndergroundHipHop.com, and the tokens have immediate consumptive value as they initially can also be used toward the purchase of goods from our e-commerce site. In 2019, we expect to launch our blockchain for increased speed and security. In addition to the marketplace itself, we want to attract popular musicians and have them feel comfortable with selling their products and services directly to the consumer via the protocol. This opens up the network to both endorsement and access to artists that are otherwise inaccessible."},paragraph6:{paragraph6:"Once the network proves effective, we will examine expansion into social channels such as Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook. Users will have the ability to message each other through the standard channels and build smart contracts directly within the browser.
