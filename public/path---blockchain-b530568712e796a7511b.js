Some key characteristics include:"},keyPropertiesBullet1:{keyPropertiesBullet1:"<p>1. Security</p>\n<p>Blockchain offers a database that is unchangeable and irreversible, which enables “trustless transactions.” This means that even the operators of the database itself cannot tamper with or alter records after they have been validated.</p>"},keyPropertiesBullet2:{keyPropertiesBullet2:"<p>2. Decentralized</p>\n<p>Block data is automatically saved on servers, or nodes, and information about transactions are instantly visible to the entire network as soon as a transaction is confirmed. Much like Google Docs enable instant collaboration with real-time visibility of one single “source of truth,” a blockchain ensures that only one record exists of each transaction, and each block.</p>"},keyPropertiesBullet3:{keyPropertiesBullet3:"<p>3. Robustness</p>\n<p>The distributed nature of blockchains creates a nearly fail-proof system, allowing no single point of failure. Altering any unit within a blockchain would involve a huge undertaking to override the entire network.</p>"},keyPropertiesBullet4:{keyPropertiesBullet4:"<p>4. Trusted</p>\n<p>Contracts for blockchains are built on a peer-to-peer basis and set conditions to validate that a transaction has been completed (ensuring all conditions have been met).
