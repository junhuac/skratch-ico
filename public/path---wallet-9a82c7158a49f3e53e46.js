Instead, your wallet stores a public and private key which are used to send and receive tokens, or ethereum."},whatIsAnEthereumWalletText3:{whatIsAnEthereumWalletText3:"In order to spend your cryptocurrency, the private key stored in your wallet has to match the public address the currency is assigned to be exchanged for. Anyone who trades with you needs to know your public key address to initiate an exchange with you. (Although the public key is assigned to you, there are no personally identifying characteristics associated with them, such as your name, address, etc.) If someone wants to exchange ethereum or goods with you, they would attach the information about that trade to the public key, which you are then able to access because of your private key."},differentTypesSubheader:"What are the different types of cryptocurrency wallets?",differentTypesText:{differentTypesText:"There are two main types of cryptocurrency wallets: hot and cold. Hot wallets are wallets that are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are offline storage for your keys. There are pros and cons for both types of storage. Hot storage (desktop, mobile, or online wallets) are more convenient to use, but the added layer of ownership means a tradeoff in security for convenience. Cold storage (hardware or paper wallets) offer a higher level of security as they’re not vulnerable to cyber-attacks, but in turn give up convenience and are the owner’s responsibility to keep track of."},differentTypesDesktopBigText:"Desktop",tabHeader:"Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.",differentTypesOnlineBigText:"Online",differentTypesOnlineText:{differentTypesOnlineText:"These wallets run in the cloud and can be accessed from any computing device, anywhere.
